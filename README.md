**This is kinda cheat sheet & intended for anyone who is already good at (any) programming language i.e. C#, Java**

# Data Types & Variables

Int, Float, Double

Bool

Character

String

**Use 'var' keyword to declare variables**
```
var x: Int = 1
var x: Double = 1.0
var x: Character = "c"  // Character: Same as C charater but double quote
var y: String = "Hello Hooman"   
```

# Constant

**Use 'let' keyword to declare constants**
```
let pi: Double = 3.1416
let pi: String = "Swift is fun"
```

# Type Inference
```
let pi = 3.1416          // type Doudle is inferred from the assigned value
let pi = "Swift is fun"  // type String is inferred from the assigned value
```
